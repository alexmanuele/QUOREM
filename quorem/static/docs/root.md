# Welcome to your QUOR'em Wiki!

In this Wiki, you will find automatically-generated pages for your investigations, samples, replicates, and more. Automated wiki reports are automatically refreshed, but a manual refresh can be done by the administrator with the `manage.py refreshwiki` command.

You may edit anything on any page (including this one!). These pages were set as useful defaults. Fill in the Investigation pages with other details (project goals, targeted journal, authors' contact information, etc.). Add the location of the sample in the freezer, or a table showing which assays have been completed. This Wiki is **yours**. It will store all revision history, so don't be afraid to make changes!
