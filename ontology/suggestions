1. General Process Overview
- To find a link, a column label will be tokenized and stemmed. All combinations and permutations of the
  stemmed tokens will be searched in the ontology labels corpus.
  e.g. "Temperature at Sampling Point (C)"
      -> ['temperatur', 'sampl', 'point']
      -> ['*temperatur*', 
	   '*sampl*', 
	   '*point*', 
	   '*temperatur*sampl*', 
	   '*temparatur*point*',
	   '*sampl*temperatur*', 
	   '*sampl*point*',
           '*point*temperatur*',
	   '*point*sampl*]
	-> [list of ontology terms]
    The highest priority options will be those which match the largest number of search terms.

2. Refinement suggestions
 - Use upload logic to refine ontology search.
   e.g. IF sample is uploaded, refine search by subclass_of='sample' (or whatever is appropriate, more work needs to be done.)

3. Spelling mistake handling
 - Coul dmake a corpus of all ontology terms. Then, if general process finds no matches, could suggest the highest probabilty of the misspelled word from the corpus. If subsequently no matches are found, then offer the user the option to upload w/o onto links.

Important caveats
- Should we ignore anything in brackets? This at first seems sensible but mayeb it isn't.
  An additional parsing module could try to determine if the brackets contain unit specifications.
