Comeau_16S_V6-V8	16S rRNA gene sequencing on MiSeq (CGEB IMR), V6-V8	Comeau et al., 2017	pcr	DNA amplification by polymerase chain reaction	validation	Invitrogen E-gel	The duplicate PCRs are combined in one plate and then verified visually by running a high-throughput Invitrogen 96-well E-gel. Any samples with failed PCRs (or spurious bands) are reamplified by optimizing PCR conditions to produce correct bands in order to complete the sample plate(s) before continuing.
